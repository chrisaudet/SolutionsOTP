# SolutionsOTP
Simple website to generate OTP codes.  Shamelessly adapted from the work of https://github.com/gbraad/gauth

This was created to be embedded as a tab inside of Microsoft Teams, and allow many team members to share MFA codes for a single account.

For bonus points, host it using Azure websites, and use conditional access policies to restrict access to employees with AzureAD accounts.
